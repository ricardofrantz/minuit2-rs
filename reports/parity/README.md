# Parity Artifacts

Current status:
- These parity artifacts are generated against ROOT Minuit2:
  - repo: `root-project/root`
  - subtree: `math/minuit2`
  - baseline tag: `v6-36-08`
  - resolved commit (current report): `a8ca1b23e38d7dbe0ff24027894ca0f2ad65f1bd`

These artifacts are generated by:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_parity_report.py --repo root-project/root --subdir math/minuit2 --tag v6-36-08
```

Generated files:
- `reports/parity/functions.csv`: function-level mapping rows.
- `reports/parity/gaps.md`: status summary and top unresolved files.
- `reports/parity/missing.csv`: filtered rows with `status == missing`.
- `reports/parity/needs_review.csv`: filtered rows with `status == needs-review`.

Notes:
- The current extractor is heuristic (regex + scope filtering), not a full C++ AST parser.
- `status` values:
  - `implemented`: one confident symbol-name match in mapped Rust files.
  - `missing`: no symbol match in mapped Rust files.
  - `needs-review`: ambiguous mapping, architectural refactor, or extraction limitations.
  - `intentionally-skipped`: constructor/destructor/operator idioms handled differently in Rust.
